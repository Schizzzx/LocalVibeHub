### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file inside the `/backend` directory:

```ini
PORT=5000
# use another for MacOS
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username

##  Reviewer Instructions

- All user and event data is stored in MySQL under the `localvibe` schema.
- Admin access is granted by setting the `role` field to `1` for a user in the `users` table.

###  How to create an admin user:

1. Register a user via the website.
2. Copy the user's ID from the URL (e.g., `/profile/4`).
3. In MySQL terminal:

```sql
USE localvibe;
UPDATE users
SET role = 1
WHERE id = 4;
```

(Change `4` to the correct user ID.)

## ðŸ“¬ Notifications

- The system sends both internal and email notifications.
- Email delivery requires working SMTP credentials (preferably via MailerSend).
